## Prompt

phase 2

## Response snapshot

Executed Phase 2: Foundational Research and Preparation for Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

Tasks Completed:
- T005: Researched and documented 4 real-world Physical AI use cases (Warehouse Automation, Healthcare Assistance, Disaster Response, Manufacturing Cobots) with detailed descriptions, characteristics, examples, and impacts
- T006: Researched authoritative sources and prepared 2-4 APA citations (ROS 2 docs, NVIDIA Isaac, RT-2/VLA research, embodied cognition theory)
- T007: Created SVG diagram specifications with Infima theme colors, tool recommendations, and complete specifications for all 4 required diagrams
- T008: Created comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility validation checklist covering Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust principles

Artifacts Created:
- use-cases.md: Detailed documentation of 4 Physical AI use cases with real-world examples
- citations.md: APA citation strategy with 4 primary sources and additional supporting references
- diagram-specifications.md: Complete specifications for 4 SVG diagrams with color palette, dimensions, alt text
- accessibility-checklist.md: Comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA validation checklist with 100+ items

All Phase 2 tasks marked as complete in tasks.md. Foundation established for content creation phases.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase 2 complete - research artifacts ready for content creation
- 🧪 Tests: Documentation artifacts validated for completeness
- 📁 Files: Created 4 foundational documents (use-cases, citations, diagrams, accessibility)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Phase 3 (US1 content writing) or continue with subsequent phases
- 🧠 Reflection: Comprehensive research foundation established with actionable artifacts

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all research tasks completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Documentation completeness - PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with Phase 3 content writing
