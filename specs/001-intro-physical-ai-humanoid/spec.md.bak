# Feature Specification: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Feature Branch**: `001-intro-physical-ai-humanoid`
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics - Target audience: AI engineers, robotics developers, and advanced students"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-12-23

- Q: What balance should the introduction strike between theoretical explanation and practical examples when introducing Physical AI concepts? → A: Balance theoretical foundations with practical examples and use cases

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Understanding Physical AI Fundamentals (Priority: P1)

A software engineer with AI/ML experience wants to understand what Physical AI is and how it differs from traditional AI systems before diving into technical modules.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational knowledge required for all subsequent learning. Without understanding Physical AI concepts, readers cannot effectively engage with technical implementations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a reader quiz or assessment that verifies comprehension of Physical AI definitions, scope, and differentiation from traditional AI systems. Delivers value by establishing clear mental models.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader with AI/ML background but no robotics experience, **When** they complete this section, **Then** they can articulate what Physical AI means and provide examples
2. **Given** a reader unfamiliar with embodied AI, **When** they read the introduction, **Then** they can explain the difference between traditional AI and Physical AI
3. **Given** a reader interested in humanoid robotics, **When** they complete the section, **Then** they understand why humanoid form factors are relevant for Physical AI

### User Story 2 - Grasping the Technology Stack (Priority: P2)

A robotics developer wants to understand how ROS 2, Digital Twins, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems fit together in the overall architecture before learning each component individually.

**Why this priority**: Understanding the system architecture and how components interact prevents confusion during module-specific learning and helps readers see the bigger picture.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested through a system architecture diagram exercise where readers identify which components handle specific responsibilities and how they communicate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader starting the book, **When** they review the stack overview, **Then** they can identify the role of each major component (ROS 2, Digital Twin, Isaac, VLA)
2. **Given** a reader planning their learning path, **When** they understand the stack, **Then** they can explain how data flows between simulation, planning, and physical execution
3. **Given** a developer evaluating tools, **When** they read the stack explanation, **Then** they understand why each technology was chosen and what problems it solves

### User Story 3 - Preparing for Modular Learning (Priority: P3)

A student wants to understand the book structure and learning approach so they can navigate modules effectively and set appropriate learning expectations.

**Why this priority**: While helpful for learning efficiency, this is preparatory information that supports but is not essential to core concept understanding.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by readers successfully navigating to specific modules based on their learning goals and understanding prerequisites.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader browsing the introduction, **When** they review the learning approach section, **Then** they understand the book follows a modular, spec-driven methodology
2. **Given** a reader planning their study schedule, **When** they see the module overview, **Then** they can identify which modules align with their current skill level
3. **Given** a reader with limited time, **When** they understand the structure, **Then** they can skip to relevant modules without confusion

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a reader has no prior AI or robotics background? (Introduction should establish sufficient baseline knowledge or point to prerequisites)
- How does the introduction serve readers who only want to implement specific modules vs. those seeking comprehensive understanding?
- What if readers are familiar with traditional robotics but unfamiliar with LLM integration?

- Readers can read technical documentation and follow installation guides
- Readers have access to a development machine capable of running simulation environments
- Readers are motivated to learn both theoretical concepts and practical implementation
